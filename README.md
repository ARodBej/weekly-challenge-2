This week I created a portfolio for future employers.

I applied many features to make this webpage more appealing and even added some JavaScript to make my portfolio more appealing such as: 
    -modals
    -buttons 
I did reach out to friends and Google to help me with the JavaScript functions but I'm happy with the result.

I made sure to make the li buttons in the header scroll down to where it is on the page.

I limited the amount of colors used so it's not overwhelming.

The was the nav's background image scrolls down when you do was something new i learned how to do along with modals and buttons.
